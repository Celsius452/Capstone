# Capstone

#In this repository, you will find several folders, containing the final Capstone submission as well as some tutorials found to be useful.

#There is also a written report that describes the process executed in this project.  

#This project utilizes R/RStudio to obtain diabetic patient data, perform pre-processing, integrate the datasets, annotate cell type identity, compare beta cells, and visualize key differentially expressed genes.

#Tools/packages used include but are not limited to Harmony for integration, SingleR for cell type annotation, and FindMarkers to compare beta cells between diabetic and non diabeetic groups.
